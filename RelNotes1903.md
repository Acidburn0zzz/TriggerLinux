# Triggerbox 19.03 Release Notes
Although it is rolling release (as is upstream Arch Linux, whose repositories it does still use), Triggerbox still, also like Arch Linux, releases snapshots every month, starting with this first stable release. Download link will be edited into this file as soon as the file is uploaded to MEGA (which WILL take a long time).

## Feature Changes and Bug Fixes

[*] Linux Kernel 5.0
[*] Gab icon on desktop now works
[*] Gab [Dissenter](https://dissenter.com) extension now bundled
[*] Builds work properly after quite a bit of trial and error due to upstream package issues

## Known Issues

TODO: If you find a bug, post it (along with all necessary system logs) in the [Issues](https://github.com/realKennyStrawn93/Triggerbox/issues) section and I will add all issues listed to this section along with ticket references.
